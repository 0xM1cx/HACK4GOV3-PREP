the true PCI topology and makes the frontend
   there is a single PCI bus with only the exported devices on it.
   For example, a device at 03:05.0 will be re-assigned to 00:00.0
   while second device at 02:1a.1 will be re-assigned to 00:01.1.
 1 - Passthrough provides a real view of the PCI topology to the
   frontend (for example, a device at 06:01.b will still appear at
   06:01.b to the frontend). This is similar to how Xen 2.0.x
   exposed PCI devices to its driver domains. This may be required
   for drivers which depend on finding their hardward in certain
   bus/slot locations.
